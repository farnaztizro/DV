    <h1>Comparative Analysis of Life Expectancy, GDP, and Population Among Top Economies</h1>
    <h1>Type: Heatmap</h1>
    <p>This heatmap presents a comparative analysis of three key metrics—Life Expectancy, GDP, and Population—across
        five major economies: the United States, China, India, Japan, and Germany. The color intensity represents the
        relative magnitude of each metric, normalized for better comparison. By visualizing these metrics together, the
        heatmap provides an intuitive understanding of how these countries perform in terms of average life expectancy,
        economic output, and population size, highlighting significant patterns and differences that might not be
        immediately apparent from raw data alone.
