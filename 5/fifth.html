    <h1>Normalized Comparison of Life Expectancy, GDP, and Population Across Major Economies</h1>
    <h1>Type: Grouped Bar Chart</h1>
    <p>This grouped bar chart offers a normalized comparison of three essential metrics—Life Expectancy, GDP per capita,
        and Population—across five significant economies: the United States, China, India, Japan, and Germany. Each bar
        group represents a country, with individual bars displaying normalized values for each metric. Normalization
        ensures that the differences in scale between these metrics are accounted for, enabling a clearer visual
        comparison. This chart provides a comprehensive overview of how these countries compare in terms of health
        outcomes, economic performance, and demographic size, facilitating a deeper understanding of their relative
        standings.
